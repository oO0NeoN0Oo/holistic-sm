Building an Enterprise Service Management application

The idea of this project is to introduce an application for all departments within an organisation
to use that will only show parts that are relevant to their roles. This will bring together a host of
Service Management tools, as modules, into a single application that can be accessed via web browser.

Initial phase is to build a ticketing system for fault reporting.
2nd phase is to create a Configuration Management module, starting with User accounts and roles, requires to link into MS Active Directory to pull information.
3rd phase is to add Asset Management and link user roles with assets (Due to the nature of the organisation, this will be an ongoing phase throughout)
4th phase is to link into Oracle for Personnel administration

More phases will follow...
